# Token Burn Mechanism

## Project Description
Create a deflationary token with burn on transfer, written in Solidity. This smart contract has no imports, no constructors, and no input fields.

## Smart Contract Address
```
0xDA0bab807633f07f013f94DD0E6A4F96F8742B53
```

## Features
- Deflationary token model
- Automatic burn mechanism on every transfer
- No imports or constructors
- Simple and efficient implementation

## How It Works
- Every transfer burns a percentage of tokens, reducing total supply over time.
- Users can approve others to spend tokens on their behalf with the same burn mechanism applying.

## Getting Started
To interact with the smart contract, use any Ethereum-compatible wallet or tool such as Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.
